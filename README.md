data.table_demo

## Introduction

This code was used to demonstrate the features of the data.table package at the R User Group meetup held in Chicago on February 7th, 2013.

The data and project related to this exmaple comes from another meetup and code project.  I attended that meetup, and put together some simple visualizations for inspiration.  These visualizations were intended to be used as talking points for the project.  I repurposed this data to provide some `data.table` examples.
